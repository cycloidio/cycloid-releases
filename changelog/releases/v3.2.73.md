### Organizations
**FIXED**
- Organizations: Ensured that GetOrganizationByCanonical sets the corresponding HasChildren field ([BE#3875])*Organizations: fixed an issue where getOrgAncestors was not returning the full hierarchy of organizations, due to a missing field flagging whether a certain organization had children or not, as it is fetched*
### Other

### Inventory

### Organizations
**CHANGED**

### Cloud Cost Management
**FIXED**

### StackForms
**FIXED**
- TextArea (map) widget now triggers validation errors when duplicate keys entered ([FE#6694])
*Fixes an issue where, when entering a JSON object with duplicate keys, the key at the lower position was replacing all the previous duplicates, without noticing the user about what's happening.
We now stop the replacing, which allows users to fix the incorrect input, and display also a proper validation error.*
### Authentication
**FIXED**
- Fixed issue regarding authenticaion on user endpoints ([BE#4078])*The user no longer will get an error when navigating to the User profile*
### Inventory

### Other

### Pipelines Overview
**FIXED**
- Unbound (empty) variables are now accepted in PP configuration ([BE#4077])*Unbound (empty) variables are now accepted in PP configuration*
### Pipeline view
**FIXED**
- Resource: Fix error status displayed when resource is successful ([FE#6716])
*The resource was reported as failed while it was checked successfuly. The issue was on a wrong condition as the logic changed with concourse 7*
### Concourse
**FIXED**
- Internal error when logging Concourse Build Event errors ([BE#4101])
### Inventory
**FIXED**
- Now rtfstate service GCP implementaion returns a 404 when not found ([BE#4100])*GCP external backends using Inventory now will work as expected*
### Pipeline view
**FIXED**
- Builds: Fix workers metadata displaying twice ([FE#6726])

**ADDED**
- Builds: Add volume streaming metadata ([FE#6727])
*With concourse 7, instead of copying volumes from a worker to another, we have now the possibility to stream this volume. It makes the use of volumes faster as the pool scales.*
### Config Repo
**ADDED**
- Credentials on list page now link to credential details ([FE#6710])

### Pipeline view
**FIXED**
- Resource: Fix enable/disable versions ([FE#6735])
*With the last concourse version, when enabling or disabling a version, the endpoint doesn't return data anymore. So, before this fix, the query was still made correctly but the display wasn't refreshing. Now the query is fired and if there's no error returned, we assume that the enable/disable has been done correctly.*
### Other
**ADDED**
- Launch and reset product tour button from help menu ([FE#6566])
